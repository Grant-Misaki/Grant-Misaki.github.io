For this WOD, we had to make an invoice using html and javascript.

In this WOD, I had some problems with the javascript. 
One thing that definitely helped was using the source code as a template and just replacing the irrelevant data fromt the table with my own.
Like with the other wod's, I prepared by just trying to work through it slowly once to get an understanding of what I was doing, 
but I ended up getting tripped up a few times and I realized that I was actually making my table a little differently than the way we were instructed, 
while it more or less looked the same, I decided that this was probably not a good idea seeing as we tend to reuse previous assignments in this class.
I probably could have prepared better by reading the whole page before starting on the wod, 
I would have ran into the hints much sooner and saved myself a lot of time and energy.
