  I had no idea how to start Browser History 1, so I went back and actually did the readings, like we were supposed to.  
Then, after reading the resources on html, I started my "first" attempt.  This first attemp took me quite a while,
and I found myself going back and referencing the html reading often.  I had a hard time with the internal links, I could not remember which tag to use where.  
Anyway, it was obvious that I did not have enough of an understanding of the language to start an attempt, as I was still getting stuck.  
I went back to the reading and tried to memorize which line did what.  After About two more practice attempts, I felt that I was ready to record my attempt.
I ended up forgetting to restart my stop watch, so I ended that attempt frustrated.
Intelisense was kind of annoying for the paragraph tags, I tried to move the end tag to the end of the last line of that section, but my track pad was a little bit sensitive, so I had a hard time trying to get it to move to where I wanted it. 
This was my own fault for being stuborn, after a while I ended up just using copy and paste instead of trying to drage the highlighted end tag. 
While it was annoying in some instances, other times,  it was quite helpful and saved me some time in some areas.
Aside from that I feel that it went okay.  I found that for me the easiest way to do the WOD was to try to learn the language, at least the parts that we will use, 
and using my attempts to help me to reinforce how the language works, and what each component does. After I understood what the tags are actually doing, 
I had an easier time remembering what tag to use, and how to format them.  I think that this is because this is how I learned in my ICS 111 class at LCC.  
  For Browser History 2, I read the CSS tutorial, and proceded to start formatting,  I ran into some issues trying to align the logos with the text. 
After trying a few things, I got suspicious that my webpage did not seem to change at all, so I went into inspect, and disabled cache.  
After disabling cache, I reloaded the page and saw that my changes were being displayed.  So that is one thing that I would definitely do when your changes don't seem to be going through.
  For Browser History 3, I ran into some issues trying to get the text into three columns, after trying a few things that did not work, I gave up and watched the screen cast.  
After watching the video, I had a much easier time formating my webpage. For this WOD, I wish I had watched the screen cast sooner, as the reading was not sufficient to complete the tasks. 
After watching the video, I still had a little bit of a hard time with the CSS, but I re-watched the video and tried to remember what each property did to its selector, and this made it easier to 
remember what properties go where.  

  My advice for the WODs would be to do the readings, make an attempt at the WOD, and if/when you get stuck then go to the screen cast and watch it all the way through.  
  If you just watch the screen cast without doing the readings, you will get lost, and have a hard time trying to do the exercise.  
  Also try to start on them as soon as you can, that way if you run into problems, you can ask questions and understand the material before it is due.  
  If you have the time, I would just spend your first/second attempt trying to understand what you are doing.
