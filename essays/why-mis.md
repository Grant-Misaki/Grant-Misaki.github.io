I was an engineering student at Leeward, where I took ICS 111.  
In that course, we learned java, and had to write programs to fulfill certain tasks. 
I really enjoyed this class and it piqued my interest.  I was putting in more effort into my code.
Sometimes I would incorporate other things we learned to do into my program just to make it more practical.  
I would mostly just incorporate exceptions and try to account for human error if the program required input from the "user".  
None the less it felt fulfilling, and then I passed the class and went on with my engineering major. 
Then I had to take Calc 1 and I felt that I did not receive an adequate education to build off of for another 3 semesters, so I left the engineering major and went into exploratory business.
Later I recalled how coding gave me a sense of fulfillment or satisfaction, that I was not very familiar with.  
I really enjoyed the level of control coding gives you. You get to create something and improve it until it functions exactly how you want it to.
I hope to either go into programming or use the knowledge I gain from my MIS major to help me start/run my own business.  
Looking back I am glad I didn't go into engineering, because it was not that I was passionate about it, I just saw it as a way for me to make money so that I could do things I enjoy.
